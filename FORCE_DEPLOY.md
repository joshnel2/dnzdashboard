# Force Vercel to Deploy New Code

## Your Issue
You're seeing old logs without emojis, but the new code with emojis IS committed and pushed.

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Force Redeploy in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Find the latest deployment
5. Click the three dots (...) menu
6. Click "Redeploy"
7. Make sure "Use existing Build Cache" is **UNCHECKED**
8. Click "Redeploy"

### Option 2: Push an Empty Commit
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force rebuild"
git push
```

### Option 3: Clear Vercel Build Cache via CLI
If you have Vercel CLI:
```bash
vercel --force
```

## After Deploying

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
2. Go to your app URL
3. Do a HARD REFRESH: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
4. Open console (F12)

## What You Should See (NEW logs with emojis)
```
üîç [ClioService] Fetching dashboard data...
üìÑ [ClioService] Fetching paginated data from /time_entries.json...
üìÑ Fetching page 1...
‚è±Ô∏è  Time entries received: { count: X, ... }
üì• RAW INPUT DATA: { timeEntriesCount: X, ... }
üìÖ Time Entry Date Range: { earliest: "...", latest: "..." }
```

## What You're Currently Seeing (OLD logs without emojis)
```
[ClioService] getDashboardData() Object
[ClioService] API responses received Object
[ClioService] transformData() Object
```

If you still see the OLD logs after redeploying, Vercel is serving from cache.
